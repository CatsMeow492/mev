# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The L2 MEV Strategy Engine is a real-time MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) detection and execution pipeline designed for Ethereum Layer 2 networks, specifically Base. The system monitors pending transactions via WebSocket connections, simulates their effects using a local EVM fork, and identifies profitable arbitrage, sandwich, and backrun opportunities. The engine provides real-time visualization of detected opportunities and their profitability estimates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to monitor the Base mempool in real-time, so that I can detect profitable trading opportunities as they emerge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to Base RPC endpoint
2. WHEN connected to Base RPC THEN the system SHALL subscribe to pending transactions using eth_subscribe
3. WHEN a pending transaction is received THEN the system SHALL add it to an in-memory priority queue
4. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
5. WHEN transactions are queued THEN the system SHALL maintain ordering based on gas price and nonce

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to simulate transaction effects on a forked environment, so that I can predict market impact without executing real trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a local EVM fork of Base mainnet using Anvil or Foundry
2. WHEN a target transaction is identified THEN the system SHALL replay it on the forked environment
3. WHEN replaying transactions THEN the system SHALL measure token balance changes, price deltas, and slippage
4. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL calculate gas usage and execution costs
5. IF simulation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other transactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to detect sandwich attack opportunities, so that I can profit from large swaps with low slippage tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a pending swap transaction THEN the system SHALL check if the swap amount exceeds the sandwich threshold
2. WHEN a large swap is detected THEN the system SHALL verify the slippage tolerance is below the profitable threshold
3. WHEN sandwich conditions are met THEN the system SHALL construct front-run and back-run transactions
4. WHEN constructing sandwich transactions THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal gas prices for priority ordering
5. WHEN sandwich opportunity is validated THEN the system SHALL estimate net profit after gas costs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to detect backrun opportunities, so that I can profit from price gaps created by other traders' swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a swap transaction creates a price discrepancy THEN the system SHALL detect the arbitrage opportunity
2. WHEN price gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL calculate the optimal trade size to capture profit
3. WHEN backrun conditions are met THEN the system SHALL construct the arbitrage transaction
4. WHEN estimating backrun profit THEN the system SHALL account for gas costs and slippage
5. IF multiple backrun opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize by expected profit margin

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to detect frontrun opportunities, so that I can profit by executing similar trades before high-value transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing pending transactions THEN the system SHALL identify high-value trades that can be frontrun
2. WHEN frontrun opportunities are detected THEN the system SHALL construct transactions with higher gas prices
3. WHEN calculating frontrun profit THEN the system SHALL account for the original transaction's impact on prices
4. WHEN multiple frontrun opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize by profit potential and execution probability
5. IF frontrun execution would result in net loss THEN the system SHALL skip the opportunity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to detect time bandit opportunities, so that I can profit from reordering transactions within the same block.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related transactions are pending THEN the system SHALL analyze optimal ordering for maximum profit
2. WHEN time bandit opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL calculate the profit from transaction reordering
3. WHEN constructing time bandit bundles THEN the system SHALL ensure all transactions remain valid after reordering
4. WHEN estimating time bandit profit THEN the system SHALL account for bundle submission costs and block inclusion probability
5. IF transaction dependencies prevent reordering THEN the system SHALL identify and respect those constraints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to see real-time visualization of detected opportunities, so that I can monitor system performance and profitability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects an MEV opportunity THEN it SHALL display the transaction hash, strategy type, and expected profit
2. WHEN displaying opportunities THEN the system SHALL show gas cost estimates and execution latency
3. WHEN opportunities are processed THEN the system SHALL update the status (pending, simulated, profitable, unprofitable)
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL show historical performance metrics and success rates
5. IF the system is a terminal application THEN it SHALL provide a text-based user interface with real-time updates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to parse and analyze transaction events, so that I can trigger strategies based on specific contract interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL decode event logs using contract ABIs
2. WHEN Swap events are detected THEN the system SHALL extract token addresses, amounts, and pool information
3. WHEN bridge events (Deposit/Withdraw) are detected THEN the system SHALL identify cross-layer arbitrage opportunities
4. WHEN parsing events THEN the system SHALL handle multiple event types from different DEX protocols (Uniswap V2/V3, Aerodrome)
5. IF event parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other events

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want to maintain a regression testing harness, so that I can validate strategy performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profitable opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL log transaction details for replay testing
2. WHEN running regression tests THEN the system SHALL replay historical transactions on forked environments
3. WHEN regression tests complete THEN the system SHALL compare actual vs expected profitability
4. WHEN strategy thresholds are updated THEN the system SHALL validate changes against historical data
5. IF regression tests fail THEN the system SHALL alert operators and prevent strategy deployment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want the system to handle high-frequency data processing, so that I can compete effectively in the MEV market.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing mempool data THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 transactions per second
2. WHEN simulating transactions THEN the system SHALL complete simulations within 100ms average latency
3. WHEN multiple opportunities are detected THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently
4. WHEN system load is high THEN it SHALL prioritize higher-value opportunities
5. IF processing latency exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL emit performance alerts

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a MEV searcher, I want the system to monitor performance and automatically shut down during poor conditions, so that I can prevent significant losses from unprofitable trading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL track profitability metrics over rolling time windows
2. WHEN the loss rate exceeds 70% over the last 100 trades THEN the system SHALL enter warning mode
3. WHEN in warning mode AND loss rate exceeds 80% over the last 50 trades THEN the system SHALL automatically shut down
4. WHEN shutting down THEN the system SHALL log the reason, performance metrics, and timestamp
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL send alerts before reaching shutdown thresholds
6. IF manual override is enabled THEN operators SHALL be able to bypass automatic shutdown with explicit confirmation
